# Project: Questioning AI about YouTube Video with Streamlit Interface

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a user interface using Streamlit to interact with an artificial intelligence (AI) capable of answering questions related to a YouTube video. The AI will be trained to understand the content of the video and provide accurate answers to user-formulated questions.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit:** A Python library for easily creating interactive web applications.

- **YouTube API:** The YouTube API will be used to obtain information about the video.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** GPT-3.5 model utilized through the OpenAI API.

## Project Structure

The project will be divided into the following main components:

1. **User Interface with Streamlit:**
   - Main screen allowing the user to enter the YouTube video URL.
   - Section to input questions that will be posed to the AI.

2. **Integration with YouTube API:**
   - Extraction of video information using the YouTube API.

3. **Question and Answer Model (Q&A):**
   - Implementation through the API.
   - Generation of answers based on the analysis of the video content.

4. **Deployment:**
   - Configuration of a production environment for the Streamlit application.
   - Implementation of the interface and AI logic on an accessible web server.
